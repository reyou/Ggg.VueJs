### Installing the @vue/cli Package

The @vue/cli package is the standard way to create and manage Vue.js projects during development. You
donâ€™t have to use this package, but it provides everything that is needed to get started with Vue.js, and I use it
throughout this book.

### Installing the Vue Tools Package

```
$ npm install --global @vue/cli
```

### Run App

```
$ npm run json
$ npm run serve
```

### Copy Folder

```
$ Copy-Item "qqq\*" -Destination "www" -Recurse -Force
```
