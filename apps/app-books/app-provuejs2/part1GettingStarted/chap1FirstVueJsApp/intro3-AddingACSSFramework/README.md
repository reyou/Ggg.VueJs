### Installing the @vue/cli Package

The @vue/cli package is the standard way to create and manage Vue.js projects during development. You
donâ€™t have to use this package, but it provides everything that is needed to get started with Vue.js, and I use it
throughout this book.

### Installing the Vue Tools Package

```
$ vue create todo --default
$ cd todo
$ npm run serve
```
